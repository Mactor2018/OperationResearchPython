# Operation Reasearch with Python Numpy

This is a repo implementing LP, IP and other classic OR  problems and models using Python.

The possibly only **requirement** is :
``` 
python>=3.9
```

And it is recommended that `numpy==1.26.4`.

TODOs:
- [x] Linear Programming (`LP.py`)
- [x] Integer Programming (`LP.py`)
- [ ] Graph
- [ ] Others...
